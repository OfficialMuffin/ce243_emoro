## Introduction
In this assignment, I will be designing and writing a program to control an EMoRo robot to follow specific instructions when buttons are pressed on the GLAM module. Text will be displayed on the LCD of the GLAM module so a user will be able to easily identify which button to press for each function. For switch 1, the bot will move forward until the ultrasonic sensor on the front detects a obstacle. If it does, it will turn and back away from the object, then move forward in a different direction. More switch funcions are described in the TASK.md file.

### This assignment was written in C not C++, as GitHub has shown it to be.
